# 1. Project Overview

**Goal:** My concept is a risk modeling tool for insurance firms.
It's intended to leverage NOAA climate data to achieve an accurate measure of both the frequency and severity of natural disasters.
Ideally, the final product would reach a precise dollar value on insurance quotes for each county in the U.S.

**Current Phase:** The project is in a nascent stage. 
The website is in the prototype stage and we still need to determine how to gather and apply the weather data for a proper assessment. 

# 2. Page Description
The webpage is intended to provide a brief but thorough description of the service and its goals.
Additionally, it will provide relevant data for risk modeling and sort it by region.

Currently it has basic functionalities and features with JavaScript, CSS, bootstrap, and a basic HTML structure.

# 3. Website Comparison/Research Summary

Since my concept is a risk assessment tool for insurance companies, I researched several large insurance firms for the competitive analysis, including Allstate, State Farm, and Liberty Mutual. 
The website design among these 3 firms were relatively distinct but had several commonalities like search bars, an options toolbar on the top of the page, and several panels demonstrating the various insurance types they offer. 
I was unable to identify any evidence of bootstrap usage but my inexperience with bootstrap may have caused an ineffective search.
Of course, there was evidence of typical html structures like hyperlinks mand sytlistic choices for the headers and body.

# 4. Future Enhancement

I expect the data collection and anylsis to be the most difficult challenge when creating this service.
It will likely be immensely difficult to achieve an accurate dollar value for insurance quotes while reaching the ambitious scope described in the project goals.
As for the front-end, I hope to allow search functionality for relevant data for each county in the U.S.
However, this ambitious goal will likely have to be broadened to the level of each state or an even broader category.
Ideally, I would create a useful, marketable product while presenting it an a highly user-friendly manner.

# 5. GitHub Repositories

The two repositories I researched were titled climate-risk-insurances and EO-Climate-Hazard-Analysis-App. 
The former of the two attempts to determine if insurance agains climate change-related disasters are worth the cost. 
The second is an app that analyzes nautural disasters and other climate-related damages to various regions.

ChatGPT Prompts:
"please give some ideas for simple CSS classes that contain features that cannot be accomplished using bootstrap classes"
"how do I use javascript to create a simple button. It should read "Info" and when clicked, display a message that describes the purpose of the insurance service"
"How do I modify this table to create a 2 column table that lists the U.S regions and their risk score"
*Note: I also asked it to check for syntax errors and it made minor modifications to the code*

# 6. Reflection

By far, the most difficult part during research was finding GitHub repositories that aligned with the goals of my project
As for the protype, W3 schools was my primary resource as it was comprehensive enough to solve the majority of my problems
ChatGPT was immensely useful since I could use it to help generate ideas and fix syntax errors.
Because over-reliance on this tool could be an issue if used excessively, I will work to only use it when needed.
